# TuneIn Fix

**(Requires Cider 2.5 or later)**
**Known Issues - Please Read**

- If you want to switch from the active TuneIn station to another source, you may need to manually press the Stop button (which looks like a square). This will immediately return audio control to MusicKit.
- The "Play as TuneIn Radio" button searches for the station by name, which may be less accurate.
- Some stations are protected by TuneIn and won't play to prevent MusicKit from becoming unresponsive.

**About this Plugin**

Apple Music also lists radio stations on TuneIn, but these can't be played on Apple Music Web or in Cider. This plugin enables that functionality.
